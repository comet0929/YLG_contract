# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true  
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet contract-address arguments
```

``````install process
npm install hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

change the private key for security...
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_r.js

npx hardhat verify --network mainnet contract-address arguments

````````````````````
